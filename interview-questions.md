# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer:
`this` in Javascript refers to an object. It is usually refered to the object when it is called in a function or method. When we use `this` we are trying to assess a part of the corresponding objects property. Instead of using an object name , we use this `this` to call the correct object. 

  Researched answer:
The `this` functon refers to when we call a property in an object. You can not change the value of this keyword and its value depends on what object is being called or invoked.


2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer:

  Is a Javascript library where you can house code for resuse as well as different code. React was created by Facebook aka Meta. It was developed a sort of one stop shop to create and export an app. 


  Researched answer:

React is an open-source readily acccessible Javascript library that is primarily used to build user friendly applications combining javascript code and UI components. React allows us to build and create the web view of our app and mobile apps. 

3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer:

render(). I say render() because it allows us to specify what HTML code we want seen on our page. 


  Researched answer:

render() is the most commonly used lifecyce method. The render() lifecyclemethod in react goes to the root of the component and displays the JSX code intended on our app for viewing. You generally use render() to call code during various app stages or when code is updated. 



4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer:

  JSX is a combination of Javascript and HTML. It is how we write HTML in react. I like to think of JSX like a hybrid between HTML and Javascript. The difference between HTMl and JSX is that JSX is a Javascript and HTML combination that can be read in React. On the other hand HTML code can only be read with the html extension and usually does not go in an interafce such as react. JSX is more versatile and react specefic and HTML is not. 

  Researched answer:

JSX is an extension of javascript that allows you to write HTML and import to React easier. In React you can render or recall JSX directly in the HTML DOM.  HTML is a standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in the web browser. JSX is a combantiaon of HTML in Javascript that allows you to write more complex HTML code. 

5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer:

yarn is a package manager for our code. It stores dependencies locally so we dont have to store them all or re-store. It is almost like a one stop shop for all the code we need when working with interfaces such as React. It was also developed by facebook. When you run yarn, the SRC, public, node_moduels, READme.md and .json files are modified for use. 

  Researched answer:

YARN is a package manager for our code that stores many dependicies locally so we can work more wfficinetly with our code. It was developed by META. Yarn modifies the REACT app Files such as SRC, .gitignore, package.json, README.md and many other files that you will later modify in order to build your unique app.


6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer:

  These are functions without names and are functions that are usually set to be called at a certain time. It can be dropped to wherever a funtion name is used. 

  Researched answer:

Anonymous functions are funtions without identifiers with no name in a function expression. You can use the variable assigned versus a name for function. Anonymous functions work great if the expression is not altered and they are common in Javascript code. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: The ability to render different user interfaces markup if a condtion is true or false. Condtional rendering creates distinct components that give out the behavior you want. 

2. Object-oriented programming: is a programming model that was created to deal with the complex nature of larger software systems. It is a computer software porgram that organizes software design around data, or objects.

3. Ruby: Is commonly used for building web applications and is a general purpose language. It is a simple open source, object-oriented programming language.

4. Ruby blocks: these are anonymous functions that can be passed in to methods. They can end in curly braces or lines.

5. Ruby hashes: Ruby hashes are colelction of key-value pairs. The indexing is dont through object type.
